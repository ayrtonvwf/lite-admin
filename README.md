# LiteAdmin

LiteAdmin is a feature-rich CSS-only admin panel template, built with HTML (pug) and CSS (scss). See it working on the [demo/docs](https://ayrtonvwf.github.io/lite-admin).

It includes features like modals, popups, tooltips, combos, tabs, custom range inputs and progress bars. All of it built into the template, CSS-only and cross-browser consistent.

The layout is heavily inspired by [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/index2.html) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) (Bootstrap 4.1 grid is included, by the way).
