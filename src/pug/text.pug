            hr
            h2 Styling
            p You also have plenty of classes to style your text. Some give you unique features like controlling the text case, other's are useful in occasions when you don't wanna use the html tags for some reason (not messing up with semantics, easy style toggling with JS, etc).
            .row.justify-content-center
                .col-sm-10.col-md-8.col-lg-6
                    .row
                        .col-4.text-underlined .text-underlined
                        .col-4.text-striked .text-striked
                        .col-4.text-overlined .text-overlined

                        .col-4.text-bold .text-bold
                        .col-4.text-italic .text-italic

                        .col-4.text-uppercase .text-uppercase
                        .col-4.text-lowercase .text-lowercase
                        .col-4.text-capitalize .text-capitalize

                        .col-4
                            span.text-sub .text-sub
                            span normal
                            span.text-sup .text-sup
            hr
            h2 Selection
            p You can easily customize the selection color with the classes #[code selection-success], #[code selection-info], #[code selection-primary], #[code selection-warning] and #[code selection-danger]. However, if you don't want the user to select something, add the class #[code selection-none] to it.
            br
            .text-center #[span.selection-success Try selecting ]#[span.selection-info this text to ]#[span.selection-primary see how the ]#[span.selection-warning selection color ]#[span.selection-none changes with ]#[span.selection-danger this classes!]
            hr
            h2 Quoting
            p Your quotes will be automatically styled, just use the #[code blockquote] tag for a quotation block, #[code p] for paragraphs and the #[code cite] tag for author reference.
            p Of course, the default styling is boring, so choose a class to your #[code blockquote] element: #[code quote-success], #[code quote-info], #[code quote-primary], #[code quote-warning] or #[code quote-danger].
            .row.justify-content-center
