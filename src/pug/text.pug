                    p Use the html tags #[code h1], #[code h2], #[code h3] and #[code h4] wisely to hierarchically structure your page. If you need another element to look like a title, you can use the classes #[code h1], #[code h2], #[code h3] and #[code h4].

                                .col-xs-12
                                    .alert.alert-primary.text-justify This is a #[b.text-underlined justified] text so it's gonna be shrink to fit the parent. This test text needs to be this long cause the last line is not justified by default.
                    hr
                    h2 Last line alignment
                    p You can control separately the alignment of the last line, with the classes #[code text-last-left], #[code text-last-center], #[code text-last-right] and #[code text-last-justify]:
                    .row
                        .col-xs-6
                            .alert.alert-primary.text-right.text-last-left This text is aligned to the right but the last line is set to the left. This text is aligned to the right but the last line is set to the left. This text is aligned to the right but the last line is set to the left.

                    h2 Colors
                    p You have these classes to change the text color:
                    .row
                        .col-sm-10.col-sm-offset-1.col-md-8.col-md-offset-2.col-lg-6.col-lg-offset-3

                    hr
                    h2 Styling
                    p You also have plenty of classes to style your text. Some give you unique features like controlling the text case, other's are useful in occasions when you don't wanna use the html tags for some reason (not messing up with semantics, easy style toggling with JS, etc).
                    .row
                        .col-sm-10.col-sm-offset-1.col-md-8.col-md-offset-2.col-lg-6.col-lg-offset-3
                            .row
                                .col-xs-4.text-underlined .text-underlined
                                .col-xs-4.text-striked .text-striked

                                .col-xs-4.text-italic .text-italic

                                .col-xs-4.text-uppercase .text-uppercase

                                .col-xs-4

                                    span.text-sup .text-sup
                    hr
                    h2 Quoting
                    p Your quotes will be automatically styled, just use the #[code blockquote] tag for a quotation block, #[code p] for paragraphs and the #[code cite] tag for author reference.
                    p Of course, the default styling is boring, so choose a class to your #[code blockquote] element: #[code quote-success], #[code quote-info], #[code quote-primary], #[code quote-warning] or #[code quote-danger].
                    .row
                        .col-md-10.col-md-offset-1.col-lg-8.col-lg-offset-2

                                p I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. [...]
